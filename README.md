# CP-Final_project

My project is an aplication to manage a cinema.
Main features consist of: 
* buying and booking a ticket, 
* searching for screenings of a particular movie or on a particular day, 
* searching for the movie by genre.

There are 7 small classes: Customer, Movie, Row, Screening, ScreeningRoom, Seat, Ticket, 1 big 
class Cinema with needed functions, class Main, where all functions can be run and 3 Exception classes.
The application also uses 3 text files: 
* "Customers.txt" with customers' data, 
* "Movies.txt" with titles and genres of the movies
* "Showings.txt" with list of current showings
